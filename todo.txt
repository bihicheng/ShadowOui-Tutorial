Orange
=======
-Implement for Orange widgets "right-click"-run [Janez]

-Implement for Orange widgets "right-click"-duplicate [Janez]

ShadowOui
=========

-histo1  widget: do plots with histogram looking:
   (hint: display tkt["histogram_path"] vs tkt["bin_path"]
          with tkt = beam.histo1() )  [Luca]

-histo1:  add column with weight ("ref" keyword in histo1, now is
          always 23 so weigting with intensity. This should be the
          default) [Luca]

-Info widget:  Not working with combined optical elements [Manolo+Luca]
               Not displaying sysinfo [Manolo]
               Not displaying distance summary (result of 
               CompoundOE.info() )  [Luca]
               What is "system output"? The graphical representation?

-DobleCrystalMonochromator widget:
               When dimensions are infinite, it shows an error saying
               that dimensions are set to zero.
               The example shows a results compatible with the (+,+)
               configuration and not with the (+,-) configuration. Check 
               that O.E.  Orientation angle is 180 for the second crystal 
               always. [Manolo+Luca]

-Write BeamFileWriter widget (similarly to BeamFileReader). Right now it
               is implemented as script in examples  25 and 26 [Luca]


-Write a refractor O.E. widget. To discuss how to introduce the shape,
as it is not a good idea to create multiple refractors for the different
shapes, as done with mirror, crystals and gratings. 

-Transfocator widget: Displays an error message if attenuator
coefficient os zero. It can be zero (no absorption) [Luca]

-Image widget: Does not collapse to a line when keeping same aspect
ration when one direction width is much much smaller than the other
(in ex25) [Armando+Thomas]


Shadow API
==========
-In Shadow.CompoundOE.append_transfocator() add an option to create the
file mytransfocator.dat to compare easily with the shadow3 command mode.
[Manolo]

-Update automatic generation of script for Compound optical elements [Manolo]

-Sourcinfo is displaying wrong info on source optimization [Manolo]

-Write full undulator shadow3 methods [Manolo] and widget [Luca]. This
is an on-going long-term project.

-Write BeamRayPropagator method (shadow3.Beam) [Manolo] and widget [Luca]

-Implement sysinfo [Manolo]

shadow3
=======

-Remove all "STOP" in shadow3, that causes python to crash when errors
are produced [Manolo]


Problems with ShadowOui examples [Manolo]: 
==========================================

-Example 12. Missing histogram weighted with Stokes S3
-Example 13. Missing full undulator
-Example 16. Check output of the compound KB widget, some differences
with the individual definitions shown.
-Example 24. Approximate transfocator with single lens (needed refractor
widget). Surceinfo on accepted/rejected rays is wrong.
-Example 25 (fresnel). Script not yet working)
