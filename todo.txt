ShadowOui
=========

-Info widget:  Not working with combined optical elements [Manolo+Luca]
               Not displaying sysinfo [Manolo]

-DobleCrystalMonochromator widget:
               When dimensions are infinite, it shows an error saying
               that dimensions are set to zero.


-Image widget: Does not collapse to a line when keeping same aspect
ration when one direction width is much much smaller than the other
(in ex25) [Armando+Thomas]


Shadow API
==========
-shadow API: mirinfo should also work for compoundOE

-In Shadow.CompoundOE.append_transfocator() add an option to create the
file mytransfocator.dat to compare easily with the shadow3 command mode.
